# embedsky

Really, really simple Bluesky embed fixer. Supports embedding posts & profiles. Designed to sit behind a cache.

## How to use?

Just replace "bsky.app" in your Bluesky link with "embedsky.app".

## Why not vxbsky.app or (some other domain)?

I didn't want to make it look like the person who made [BetterTwitFix](https://github.com/dylanpdx/BetterTwitFix) was in control of the project without their consent.  
As for the 2nd point, I just didn't think about the domain long enough. Something like embsky.app would be better.
If there's someone who would like to purchase that domain and setup a redirect, you're more than welcome to.
